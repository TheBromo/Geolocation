//IMPORTANT: this needs to be called after the container div
/*
 * if google maps is used and the advanced SKU:
 * https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/usage-and-billing
 * Note: for the basic map and marking spots on a map there is no need for the advanced SKU
 *
 * here i use the leaflet library: https://leafletjs.com/
 * with the tiles from Map box: https://www.mapbox.com/
 *
 * Limitations:
 * - When the device does not have GPS, the position can be inaccurate.
 * - Needs permission
 * - Cant get the ip in local javascript, if the ip would be available the approximate
 * position(very inaccurate because it's the providers position) could be found out. This would work with a link
 * like this:http://www.geoplugin.net/json.gp?ip=62.30.218.130.
 *
 * With this code:
var settings = {
  "async": true,
  "crossDomain": true,
  "url": "http://www.geoplugin.net/json.gp?ip=62.30.218.130",
  "method": "GET",
  "headers": {
    "cache-control": "no-cache",
    "Postman-Token": "f4365f1a-1b64-4258-a199-59b693e83a85"
  }
}

$.ajax(settings).done(function (response) {
  console.log(response);
});

 *This will return a json file with the geodata
